# Orbiter

Content management tool for Orbit Image platforms. Made with Angular.

## Note: Orbiter is currently alpha-phase software.

It has enough features to do its job but it is not yet well-structured or best-practise compliant and is missing 
(for instance) a lot of UI affordances, form validation, things like that. It's probably not worth forking at 
this time but may be useful for seeing how things are done in the Orbimg API.
